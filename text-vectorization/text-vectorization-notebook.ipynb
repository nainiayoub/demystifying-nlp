some part of that quicke spirit that is in antony let me not hinder cassius your desires ile leaue you cassi brutus i do obserue you now of late i haue not from your eyes that gentlenesse and shew of loue as i was wont to haue you beare too stubborne and too strange a hand ouer your friend that loues you bru cassius be not deceiu d if i haue veyl d my looke i turne the trouble of my countenance meerely vpon my selfe vexed i am of late with passions of some difference conceptions onely proper to my selfe which giue some soyle perhaps to my behauiours but let not therefore my good friends be greeu d among which number cassius be you one nor construe any further my neglect then that poore brutus with himselfe at warre forgets the shewes of loue to other men cassi then brutus i haue much mistook your passion by meanes whereof this brest of mine hath buried thoughts of great value worthy cogitations tell me good brutus can you see your face brutus no cassius for the eye sees not it selfe but by reflection by some other things cassius tis iust and it is very much lamented brutus that you haue no such mirrors as will turne your hidden worthinesse into your eye that you might see your shadow i haue heard where many of the best respect in rome except immortall caesar speaking of brutus and groaning vnderneath this ages yoake haue wish d that noble brutus had his eyes bru into what dangers would you leade me cassius that you would haue me seeke into my selfe for that which is not in me cas therefore good brutus be prepar d to heare and since you know you cannot see your selfe so well as by reflection i your glasse will modestly discouer to your selfe that of your selfe which you yet know not of and be not iealous on me gentle brutus were i a common laughter or did vse to stale with ordinary oathes my loue to euery new protester if you know that i do fawne on men and hugge them hard and after scandall them or if you know that i professe my selfe in banquetting to all the rout then hold me dangerous flourish and shout bru what meanes this showting i do feare the people choose caesar for their king cassi i do you feare it then must i thinke you would not haue it so bru i would not cassius yet i loue him well but wherefore do you hold me heere so long what is it that you would impart to me if it be ought toward the generall good set honor in one eye and death i th other and i will looke on both indifferently for let the gods so speed mee as i loue the name of honor more then i feare death cassi i know that vertue to be in you brutus as well as i do know your outward fauour well honor is the subiect of my story i cannot tell what you and other men thinke of this life but for my single selfe i had as liefe not be as liue to be in awe of such a thing as i my selfe i was borne free as caesar so were you we both haue fed as well and we can both endure the winters cold as well as hee for once vpon a rawe and gustie day the troubled tyber chafing with her shores caesar saide to me dar st thou cassius now leape in with me into this angry flood and swim to yonder point vpon the word accoutred as i was i plunged in and bad him follow so indeed he did the torrent roar d and we did buffet it with lusty sinewes throwing it aside and stemming it with hearts of controuersie but ere we could arriue the point propos d caesar cride helpe me cassius or i sinke i as aeneas our great ancestor did from the flames of troy vpon his shoulder the old anchyses beare so from the waues of tyber did i the tyred caesar and this man is now become a god and cassius is a wretched creature and must bend his body if caesar carelesly but nod on him he had a feauer when he was in spaine and when the fit was on him i did marke how he did shake tis true this god did shake his coward lippes did from their colour flye and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world did loose his lustre i did heare him grone i and that tongue of his that bad the romans marke him and write his speeches in their bookes alas it cried giue me some drinke titinius as a sicke girle ye gods it doth amaze me a man of such a feeble temper should so get the start of the maiesticke world and beare the palme alone shout flourish bru another generall shout i do beleeue that these applauses are for some new honors that are heap d on caesar cassi why man he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus and we petty men walke vnder his huge legges and peepe about to finde our selues dishonourable graues men at sometime are masters of their fates the fault deere brutus is not in our starres but in our selues that we are vnderlings brutus and caesar what should be in that caesar why should that name be sounded more then yours write them together yours is as faire a name sound them it doth become the mouth aswell weigh them it is as heauy coniure with em brutus will start a spirit as soone as caesar now in the names of all the gods at once vpon what meate doth this our caesar feede that he is growne so great age thou art sham d rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods when went there by an age since the great flood but it was fam d with more then with one man when could they say till now that talk d of rome that her wide walkes incompast but one man now is it rome indeed and roome enough when there is in it but one onely man o you and i haue heard our fathers say there was a brutus once that would haue brook d th eternall diuell to keepe his state in rome as easily as a king bru that you do loue me i am nothing iealous what you would worke me too i haue some ayme how i haue thought of this and of these times i shall recount heereafter for this present i would not so with loue i might intreat you be any further moou d what you haue said i will consider what you haue to say i will with patience heare and finde a time both meete to heare and answer such high things till then my noble friend chew vpon this brutus had rather be a villager then to repute himselfe a sonne of rome vnder these hard conditions as this time is like to lay vpon vs cassi i am glad that my weake words haue strucke but thus much shew of fire from brutus enter caesar and his traine bru the games are done and caesar is returning cassi as they passe by plucke caska by the sleeue and he will after his sowre fashion tell you what hath proceeded worthy note to day bru i will do so but looke you cassius the angry spot doth glow on caesars brow and all the rest looke like a chidden traine calphurnia s cheeke is pale and cicero lookes with such ferret and such fiery eyes as we haue seene him in the capitoll being crost in conference by some senators cassi caska will tell vs what the matter is caes antonio ant caesar caes let me haue men about me that are fat sleeke headed men and such as sleepe a nights yond cassius has a leane and hungry looke he thinkes too much such men are dangerous ant feare him not caesar he s not dangerous he is a noble roman and well giuen caes would he were fatter but i feare him not yet if my name were lyable to feare i do not know the man i should auoyd so soone as that spare cassius he reades much he is a great obseruer and he lookes quite through the deeds of men he loues no playes as thou dost antony he heares no musicke seldome he smiles and smiles in such a sort as if he mock d himselfe and scorn d his spirit that could be mou d to smile at any thing such men as he be neuer at hearts ease whiles they behold a greater then themselues and therefore are they very dangerous i rather tell thee what is to be fear d then what i feare for alwayes i am caesar come on my right hand for this eare is deafe and tell me truely what thou think st of him sennit exeunt caesar and his traine cask you pul d me by the cloake would you speake with me bru i caska tell vs what hath chanc d to day that caesar lookes so sad cask why you were with him were you not bru i should not then aske caska what had chanc d cask why there was a crowne offer d him being offer d him he put it by with the backe of his hand thus and then the people fell a shouting bru what was the second noyse for cask why for that too cassi they shouted thrice what was the last cry for cask why for that too bru was the crowne offer d him thrice cask i marry was t and hee put it by thrice euerie time gentler then other and at euery putting by mine honest neighbors showted cassi who offer d him the crowne cask why antony bru tell vs the manner of it gentle caska caska i can as well bee hang d as tell the manner of it it was meere foolerie i did not marke it i sawe marke antony offer him a crowne yet twas not a crowne neyther twas one of these coronets and as i told you hee put it by once but for all that to my thinking he would faine haue had it then hee offered it to him againe then hee put it by againe but to my thinking he was very loath to lay his fingers off it and then he offered it the third time hee put it the third time by and still as hee refus d it the rabblement howted and clapp d their chopt hands and threw vppe their sweatie night cappes and vttered such a deale of stinking breath because caesar refus d the crowne that it had almost choaked caesar for hee swoonded and fell downe at it and for mine owne part i durst not laugh for feare of opening my lippes and receyuing the bad ayre cassi but soft i pray you what did caesar swound cask he fell downe in the market place and foam d at mouth and was speechlesse brut tis very like he hath the falling sicknesse cassi no caesar hath it not but you and i and honest caska we haue the falling sicknesse cask i know not what you meane by that but i am sure caesar fell downe if the tag ragge people did not clap him and hisse him according as he pleas d and displeas d them as they vse to doe the players in the theatre i am no true man brut what said he when he came vnto himselfe cask marry before he fell downe when he perceiu d the common heard was glad he refus d the crowne he pluckt me ope his doublet and offer d them his throat to cut and i had beene a man of any occupation if i would not haue taken him at a word i would i might goe to hell among the rogues and so hee fell when he came to himselfe againe hee said if hee had done or said any thing amisse he desir d their worships to thinke it was his infirmitie three or foure wenches where i stood cryed alasse good soule and forgaue him with all their hearts but there s no heed to be taken of them if caesar had stab d their mothers they would haue done no lesse brut and after that he came thus sad away cask i cassi did cicero say any thing cask i he spoke greeke cassi to what effect cask nay and i tell you that ile ne re looke you i th face againe but those that vnderstood him smil d at one another and shooke their heads but for mine owne part it was greeke to me i could tell you more newes too murrellus and flauius for pulling scarffes off caesars images are put to silence fare you well there was more foolerie yet if i could remember it cassi will you suppe with me to night caska cask no i am promis d forth cassi will you dine with me to morrow cask i if i be aliue and your minde hold and your dinner worth the eating cassi good i will expect you cask doe so farewell both enter brut what a blunt fellow is this growne to be he was quick mettle when he went to schoole cassi so is he now in execution of any bold or noble enterprize how euer he puts on this tardie forme this rudenesse is a sawce to his good wit which giues men stomacke to disgest his words with better appetite brut and so it is for this time i will leaue you to morrow if you please to speake with me i will come home to you or if you will come home to me and i will wait for you cassi i will doe so till then thinke of the world exit brutus well brutus thou art noble yet i see thy honorable mettle may be wrought from that it is dispos d therefore it is meet that noble mindes keepe euer with their likes for who so firme that cannot be seduc d caesar doth beare me hard but he loues brutus if i were brutus now and he were cassius he should not humor me i will this night in seuerall hands in at his windowes throw as if they came from seuerall citizens writings all tending to the great opinion that rome holds of his name wherein obscurely caesars ambition shall be glanced at and after this let caesar seat him sure for wee will shake him or worse dayes endure enter thunder and lightning enter caska and cicero cic good euen caska brought you caesar home why are you breathlesse and why stare you so cask are not you mou d when all the sway of earth shakes like a thing vnfirme o cicero i haue seene tempests when the scolding winds haue riu d the knottie oakes and i haue seene th ambitious ocean swell and rage and foame to be exalted with the threatning clouds but neuer till to night neuer till now did i goe through a tempest dropping fire eyther there is a ciuill strife in heauen or else the world too sawcie with the gods incenses them to send destruction cic why saw you any thing more wonderfull cask a common slaue you know him well by sight held vp his left hand which did flame and burne like twentie torches ioyn d and yet his hand not sensible of fire remain d vnscorch d besides i ha not since put vp my sword against the capitoll i met a lyon who glaz d vpon me

those sparkes of life that should be in a roman you doe want or else you vse not you looke pale and gaze and put on feare and cast your selfe in wonder to see the strange impatience of the heauens but if you would consider the true cause why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts why birds and beasts from qualitie and kinde why old men fooles and children calculate why all these things change from their ordinance their natures and pre formed faculties to monstrous qualitie why you shall finde that heauen hath infus d them with these spirits to make them instruments of feare and warning vnto some monstrous state now could i caska name to thee a man most like this dreadfull night that thunders lightens opens graues and roares as doth the lyon in the capitoll a man no mightier then thy

climber vpward turnes his face but when he once attaines the vpmost round he then vnto the ladder turnes his backe lookes in the clouds scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend so caesar may then least he may preuent and since the quarrell will beare no colour for the thing he is fashion it thus that what he is augmented would runne to these and these extremities and therefore thinke him
